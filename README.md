# Insight_Dashboard

Building a Streamlit Dashboard by following these steps below:

1.	Load Data: Load the provided tables into a Database Management System (DBMS) of your choosing (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, Snowflake, etc.).
2.	Develop Dashboard: Utilize AI tools to create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to visualize the data and using this dashboard, explore the data. (You are expected to use an AI assistant (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot) to help generate the Python code for your Streamlit dashboard).
3.	Document Prompts: Keep a clear, organized log of the prompts you use to interact with the AI during your development process.

# To maintain logs we create a log file

prompts.log - adds all the prompts asked by the user during the AI interaction process.

# Run the streamlit using this command:

-- streamlit run main.py

# Loading data done using sqlite3
